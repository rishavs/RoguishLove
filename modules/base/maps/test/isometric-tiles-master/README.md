# isometric-tiles

Has four biomes: grass, arid, snow, and desert. All biomes have slopes.

Also has/will have: trees, bushes, tents, igloos, houses, rivers, paths, roads, bridges, tunnels

I'm open to suggestions. Please create an issue if you have a request for a new tile.

####Warning (Nov 2015)
This project is very young, and the tile-order is likely to change often. Don't be surprised if you start using it and all your houses are suddenly roads.
